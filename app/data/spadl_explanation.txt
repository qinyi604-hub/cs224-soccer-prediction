SPADL
Definitions
SPADL (Soccer Player Action Description Language) represents a game as a sequence of on-the-ball actions. Each action is a tuple of the same twelve attributes:

Attribute Description:

game_id: the ID of the game in which the action was performed

period_id: the ID of the game period in which the action was performed. It takes value 1 or 2, where 1 represents the first half and 2 represents the second half. 

time_seconds: the action’s start time. In spadl, it is time elapsed in seconds from the beginning of a specific half. One half is 45 minutes (2700 seconds), but this value can exceed 2700 due to stoppage time.  

player_id: the player who performed the action

team_id: the player’s team

start_x: the x location where the action started

start_y: the y location where the action started

end_x: the x location where the action ended

end_y: the y location where the action ended

type_name: the type of the action (e.g., pass, shot, dribble)

result_name: the result of the action (e.g., success or fail)

bodypart_name: the player’s body part used for the action

Start and End Locations
SPADL uses a standardized coordinate system with the origin on the bottom left of the pitch, and a uniform field of 105m x 68m. For direction of play, SPADL uses the “home team attacks to the right” convention, but this can be converted conveniently with the play_left_to_right() function such that the lower x-coordinates represent the own half of the team performing the action.

type_name
The type_name attribute can have 22 possible values. These are pass, cross, throw-in, crossed free kick, short free kick, crossed corner, short corner, take-on, foul, tackle, interception, shot, penalty shot, free kick shot, keeper save, keeper claim, keeper punch, keeper pick-up, clearance, bad touch, dribble and goal kick. A detailed definition of each action type is available here.

result_name
The result_name attribute can either have the value success, to indicate that an action achieved it’s intended result; or the value fail, if this was not the case. An example of a successful action is a pass which reaches a teammate. An example of an unsuccessful action is a pass which goes over the sideline. Some action types can have special results. These are offside (for passes, corners and free-kicks), own goal (for shots), and yellow card and red card (for fouls).

bodypart_name
The bodypart_name attribute can have 4 possible values. These are foot, head, other and none. For Wyscout, which does not distinguish between the head and other body parts a special body part head/other is used.

All actions, except for some dribbles, are derived from an event in the original event stream data. They can be linked back to the original data by the original_event_id attribute. Synthetic dribbles are added to fill gaps between two events. These synthetic dribbles do not have an original_event_id.
